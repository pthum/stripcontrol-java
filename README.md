# Stripcontrol

This project offers a small webservice with a frontend to control APA102 strips.

More specifically: 
The light switches in my apartment have a "bad UX". For my daily "workflows", they're always located in a way, that i need to put some additional effort when I want to use them. The idea to solve this problem was to use the RaspberryPi as a cloud-free smart home solution. In the current state, the RasPi drives only the LED strips, but more may come in future (such as controlling radio-controlled power sockets).

Furthermore, this project is also a playground to try different technologies, tools, etc, where the vue frontend and spring-boot application can be seen as a reference implementation of the project. Other implementations (f.i. implementations using microprofile, spark, golang, rust) may follow in the future.

## Project documentation and hardware setup
